# Flow

Flow is a solution designed to equip the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and official Hajj organizers with the capability of real-time monitoring of pilgrims’ traffic, the ability to predict and prevent dangerous congestions, and seamless Tafweej scheduling (current mechanism for organizing the traffic of pilgrims) updates.

## How it works
Flow is composed of three main elements:

1. **FlowDashboard**: a centralized intelligence dashboard. It is a web-based dashboard used by the Hajj organizing entities for monitoring and controlling pilgrims’ traffic.
2. **FlowPoint**: a data collection tool (wearable or mobile app) used by the Hajj campaign guides.
3. **FlowNetwork**: designed as a mesh network and as an independent reliable WiFi network to provide connectivity between the solution’s components.

## How we built it
React JS library has been used for developing the user interface for the web-based dashboard that provides centralized intelligence to Hajj organizers.
